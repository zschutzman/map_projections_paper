\begin{Question}
  Some further questions:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $PP_S$ goes to infinity, so what does it mean?
    \item $PP_S$ optimizes for larger shapes, as shown by Example 
      \cref{Caps_Eg}. What does this mean? \zs{I think it makes sense to restrict ourselves to subsets of the half-sphere or something like that. As we take a sequence of things on the sphere whose PP goes to infinity, the images under a diffeo to R2 grows without bound}
    \item How does the choice of projection precisely 
      game the Polsby-Popper scores?
    \item In law, is there a requirement to use a particular 
      projection?
    \item How much of an "edge case" are the non-order 
      preserved shapes? Probably not that far off, since 
      anything close to a cap would run into these issues. [On the other hand, for very small caps, they look basically Euclidean anyway... ? ] \zs{The earth is like the sphere with radius 4000 miles so any reasonably small section looks almost flat anyway.}
  \end{enumerate}
