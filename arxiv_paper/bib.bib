	abstract = {To deter gerrymandering, many state constitutions require legislative districts to be "compact."\&nbsp;Yet, the law offers few precise definitions other than "you know it when you see it,"\&nbsp;which effectively implies a common understanding of the concept. In contrast, academics have shown that compactness has multiple dimensions and have generated many conflicting measures. We hypothesize that both are correct -- that compactness is complex and multidimensional, but a common understanding exists across people. We develop a survey to elicit this understanding, with high reliability (in data where the standard paired comparisons approach fails). We create a statistical model that predicts, with high accuracy, solely from the geometric features of the district, compactness evaluations by judges and public officials responsible for redistricting, among others. We also offer compactness data from our validated measure for 20,160 state legislative and congressional districts, as well as software to compute this measure from any district.Winner of the 2018 Robert H Durr Award from the MPSA.},

	abstract = {About half of the states currently impose some form of compactness standard on their districting plans. Yet there is no commonly accepted definition of how compactness is to be measured. This paper surveys some of the principal compactness measures gleaned from the literature in political science, geography, law, and mathematics. Although some of these measures are better than others, all are defective in some crucial respect; that is, they fail to give satisfactory results on certain types of geographical configurations. The conclusion is that "compactness" is not a sufficiently precise concept to be used as a legal standard for districting plans.},
