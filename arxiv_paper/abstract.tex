In political redistricting, the \textit{compactness} of a district is
used as a quantitative proxy for its fairness.  Several
well-established, yet competing, notions of geometric compactness are
commonly used to evaluate the shapes of regions, including the
\textit{Polsby-Popper score}, the \textit{convex hull score}, and the \textit{Reock score}, and
these scores are used to compare two or more districts or plans.  In
this paper, we prove mathematically that  any \textit{map
projection} from the sphere to the plane, reverses the ordering of the scores of some pair of regions for all three of these scores and many other conceivable measures as well.
