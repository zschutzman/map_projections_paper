In political redistricting, the \textit{compactness} of a district is
used as a quantitative proxy for its fairness.  Several
well-established, yet competing, notions of geometric compactness are
commonly used to evaluate the shapes of regions, including the
Polsby-Popper score, the convex hull score, and the Reock score, and
these scores are used to compare two or more districts or plans.  In
this paper, we prove mathematically that, given any \textit{map
projection} from the sphere to the plane, that there is some pair of
regions whose score is reversed after the projection, for all three of
these measures.  Finally, we demonstrate empirically the existence of
legislative districts whose scores are permuted under the choice of
map projection.  Our proofs use elementary techniques from geometry
and analysis and should be accessible to an interested undergraduate.
